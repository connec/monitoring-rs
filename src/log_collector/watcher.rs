//! Platform-agnostic file and directory watcher.
//!
//! The [`Watcher`] trait defines a platform-agnostic interface for a file watcher, and the
//! [`watcher`] function returns an implementation of `Watcher` for the target platform.
//!
//! The [`Watcher`] interface leaves a lot of behaviour 'implementation defined'. See the caveats in
//! the [`Watcher`] documentation for more details.
//!
//! The [`imp`] module contains the `Watcher` implementation for the target platform.
